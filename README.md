# [Mathly](https://github.com/fdformula/mathly) Turns Lua into a Tiny, Portable, Free but Powerful MATLAB and More

Mathly for [Lua](https://www.lua.org) is a Lua module that turns Lua into a tiny, portable, free but powerful MATLAB and more. It provides a group of commonly
used MATLAB functions and features, including `linspace`, `zeros`, `rand`, `save`, `plot`, `plot3d`, and convenient matrix operations
as well. If there are things many love the most about MATLAB, these tools are. They make coding and testing a thought much easier and faster
than working in most other programming languages. Besides, `animate` and `manipulate` allow easy and cool animation of 2D curves.

Mathly uses Plotly JavaScript graphing tools (see https://plotly.com/javascript/) to plot graphs. Therefore, graphs are
shown in an internet browser.

The entire Mathly tool together with Lua interpreter is less than 5 MB, while providing enough features for instructors and college students
to implement numerical algorithms. <b>Because it is super lightweight and fast as well, it can run fast even on old and slow devices</b> like 
Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (Intel Core i5-6300U with 8 GB RAM). In contrast to it, MATLAB needs a few GB of storage space. In addition, 
it takes about 22 seconds to start MATLAB R2024b on a new high-end Intel Core i9-14900HX laptop with 56 GB RAM. Thus, it can hardly 
be installed on slow or pretty old computers and run smoothly. In addition, multiple sessions/instances of Lua + Mathly can coexist for
multiple tasks at the same time with each instance in its own workspace.

Mathly is especially a good choice for instructors of linear algebra and numerical computing for teaching. It takes no time to
start Lua with Mathly loaded. While developing code and doing computation in a lecture, they can simply focus on delivery
of course contents and never need to worry if their computers work too slowly. Moreover, Lua is so
simple and natural a language that students without programming skills can understand most of Lua code.

## Which version of Lua is supported? Is there any IDE for Lua + Mathly?

Mathly is developed in Lua 5.4.6. It works with Lua 5.5.0 and might also work with previous versions. You may download Lua source code in https://lua.org/ and compile it yourself or simply download prebuilt binary commands
for Microsoft Windows in, say, https://joedf.github.io/LuaBuilds/ and https://www.nuget.org/packages/lua/. Another way to get prebuilt Lua is to download
ZeroBrane Studio (https://studio.zerobrane.com/), a lightweight Lua IDE for various platforms. It comes with multiple versions of Lua.

Two text editors, [CudaText](https://github.com/fdformula/mathly/tree/main/IDE%20-%20CudaText) and [Lite XL](https://github.com/fdformula/mathly/tree/main/IDE%20-%20Lite%20XL), are each a very good "IDE" for Lua + Mathly. You may download the editors here with Lua and Mathly included and integrated.

By the way, [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/) is the internet browser. If you use a different browser, <em>you need to edit the file `browser-setting.lua`</em> coming with Mathly. See comments in the very file.

Note: The file `mathly.lua` can be compiled with `luac`. To use compiled modules, we set `package.path` first as follows:

```Lua
package.path = "./?.luac;;"
```

## Mathly objects and Lua tables

1. A Mathly table is a simple Lua table registered as a Mathly object. E.g., `x = tt{1, 2, 3}` is such a table. It has the same structure as an ordinary Lua table `y = {1, 2, 3}`. The difference is that we can apply "vectorization" operations and matrix operations on `x` instead of `y`. For instance, `2 * x - 1` gives a new Mathly table, {1, 3, 5}. Here, `x[i]` gives the i-th element in the table.

2. A Mathly row vector is actually a `1xn` matrix. E.g., `x = rr{1, 2, 3}` is a Mathly row vector. It is stored as {{1, 2, 3}}. To access 2, we must use `x[1][2]`. Similarly, a column vector `y = cc{1, 2, 3}` is a `3x1` matrix stored in the format {{1}, {2}, {3}}. We use `y[2][1]` to access 2. Indeed, `x[1][2]` or `y[2][1]` is quite strange and inconvenient, which is why the results of most operations on these row/column vectors and matrices and many Mathly functions are Mathly tables.

3. Mathly tables and matrices may simply be called Mathly objects. Mathly objects and Lua tables can appear in same math expressions. Mathly automatically converts Lua tables and Mathly tables into Mathly matrices of proper dimensions to complete the evaluation of the expressions. We may use Mathly functions such as `mathly`, `cc`, `rr`, `tt`, and `^T` to replace the automatic conversion by Mathly.

4. In a vector/matrix operation involving Lua tables which are not Mathly objects, there must be at least one Mathly object to activate the operation. For example, `tt{1, 2} + {3, 4}`, `{1, 2} + tt{3, 4}`, `({1, 2} * tt{3, 4} + {5, 6})*7 - {8, 9}`, and `tt{1, 2} * {3, 4} + ({5, 6} - tt{8, 9}) * 7`.

```Lua
mathly = require('mathly')
a = mathly{{1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4}}
b = mathly{{1}, {2}, {3}} -- or simply b = cc{1, 2, 3}
A = mathly(10, 10)        -- or rand(10, 10)
B = mathly(1, 10)         -- or rand(1, 10), a mathly table

inv(A) * B                -- B is interpreted as a 10x1 matrix
inv(A) * B^T              -- B^T can be cc(B). We control the conversion
a * {5, 6, 7}             -- Lua table {5, 6, 7} can be cc{5, 6, 7}
{5, 6} * a                -- Lua table {5, 6} can be rr{5, 6}

x = tt{2, 3, 4} + {5, 6, 7}
x ^ 3 - 5 * x ^ 2 + 4 *x - 1

A = randi({50, 100}, 3)
B = randi({0, 10}, 3)
C = 3 * A - 4 * B + 5
D = A .. B .. C           -- concatenate matrices A, B, and C horizontally
disp(D)
E = A .. cc{1, 2, 3}
disp(E)

-- matrix/table "division" is elementwise, provided for convenience only
x = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
2 * tt(x) + x - 1
x / (2 * cos(x) + 3)

A = mathly{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}
1 / (2 * A - 1)
{{2, 3}, {4, 5}} / A

-- elementary row operations
A = randi({-100, 100}, 5, 7)
A[3] = A[3] * 2         -- rowi := rowi * scaler; rr or cc
A[2] = A[2] - A[1] * 2  -- rowj := rowj - rowi * scaler; rr or cc
A[1], A[3] = A[3], A[1] -- interchange 2 rows
```

### Note
1. Part of modules dkjson.lua, http://dkolf.de/dkjson-lua, and plotly.lua, https://github.com/kenloen/plotly.lua,
is merged into this project to reduce dependencies and make it easier for users to download and use Mathly. Though
some changes have been made, full credit belongs to the original authors for whom the author of Mathly
is very grateful.

1. This project was started first right in the code of a Lua module, matrix.lua, found
in https://github.com/davidm/lua-matrix/blob/master/lua/matrix.lua, to see if Lua is good for
numerical computing. However, it failed to solve numerically a boundary value problem. The solution
was obviously wrong because the boundary condition at one endpoint is not satisfied, but the algorithm and the
code were both correct. We had to wonder if there were bugs in the module. In many
cases, it is easier to start a small project from scratch than using and debugging others' code. In
addition, matrix.lua addresses a column vector like a[i][1] and a row vector a[1][i], rather than a[i]
in both cases, which is quite ugly and unnatural. Furthermore, no basic graphics capabilities are provided in
matrix.lua. Therefore, this Mathly module was developed. But anyway, we appreciate the work in matrix.lua.
Actually, you may find some similarities in the code of matrix.lua and mathly.lua, e.g., m1, m2 are used
to name arguments of some functions.
